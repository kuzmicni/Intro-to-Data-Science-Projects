In the first project, we classify breast cancers into malignant and benign types using a supervised (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm. 

In the second project, we perform a simple feature engineering analysis and cluster iris plants into 3 types: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica; using an unsupervised (k-means) algorithm.
